## 1. Not a Medical Device
Aura is **NOT** a medical device. It has not been evaluated by the FDA or any other regulatory authority for the diagnosis, treatment, cure, or prevention of any disease or medical condition.

## 2. No Diagnostic Authority
The "Insights," "Readiness Scores," and "Neural Coach" summaries provided by Aura are for educational and motivational purposes only. 
- **DO NOT** use Aura to diagnose medical conditions (e.g., sleep apnea, clinical depression, hypertension).
- **DO NOT** alter medication, diet, or exercise programs based on Aura's output without consulting a licensed physician.

## 3. High-Strain Monitoring (AI Safety)
While Aura includes safety guards to detect distress signals (High Stress + Low Mood), these are **not** clinical suicide prevention tools or emergency response systems. If you are in a crisis, contact emergency services immediately.

## 4. Signal Accuracy
Biometric data in Aura is user-logged. The intelligence is only as accurate as the signals provided. The system accounts for human error through a **Calibration Phase**, but should never be treated as absolute biological truth.
