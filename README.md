# Aura Health Intelligence (V3)
### Anticipatory. Sovereign. Clinical-Grade.

Aura is a 2026-era health intelligence system that treats biometrics as a continuous signal rather than a static record. It combines **deterministic heuristics** with **LLM-driven pattern synthesis** to provide a predictive health narrative while ensuring absolute user sovereignty.

## 🧠 The Philosophy
Standard health apps tell you what happened. Aura tells you what is *happening*. By processing your sleep, energy, and stress through a **Neural Core**, it builds a longitudinal "Health Memory" that identifies subtle shifts in your biological baseline before they manifest as fatigue or burnout.

## 🚀 System Highlights
- **Neural Core V3**: Hybrid architecture combining Recharts-driven visualization with Gemini 1.5 Pro reasoning.
- **Safety First**: Real-time distress signal detection and "Stabilizing Mode" for high-strain biological states.
- **Local Sovereignty**: Zero-server storage. All logs and AI-synthesized memory nodes reside exclusively in the browser's persistent storage.
- **Explainable Lineage**: Every insight and memory node can be traced back to the specific biometric signals that triggered it.
