# Aura Health Intelligence (V3)
### Anticipatory. Sovereign. Clinical-Grade.

## 📄 Resume Entry (Copy & Paste)
**Aura Health Intelligence**
*   Built a privacy-first, local-first health dashboard using **React 19**, **TypeScript**, and **Google GenAI SDK**, synthesizing biometric signals into predictive readiness scores.
*   Architected a hybrid "Neural Core" that orchestrates deterministic algorithms with **Gemini 3 Pro** reasoning to detect non-linear health trends without server-side data storage.
*   Implemented multimodal AI capabilities using **Gemini Vision** to parse food images and barcodes into nutritional logs in real-time.
*   Designed a high-performance UI with **Framer Motion** and **Recharts**, ensuring 60fps animations and immediate visual feedback for complex health datasets.

---

Aura is a 2026-era health intelligence system that treats biometrics as a continuous signal rather than a static record. It combines **deterministic heuristics** with **LLM-driven pattern synthesis** to provide a predictive health narrative while ensuring absolute user sovereignty.

## 🚀 Deployment & Sharing
Aura is built as a modern, local-first ESM application. You can deploy it in seconds:
*   **Vercel:** Connect repo -> Add `API_KEY` to Env Vars -> Deploy.
*   **Netlify:** Connect repo -> Add `API_KEY` to Site Settings -> Deploy.
*   **Cloudflare Pages:** Connect repo -> Select 'Static' -> Add Env Vars.
