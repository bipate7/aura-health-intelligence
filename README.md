# Aura Health Intelligence (V3)
### Anticipatory. Sovereign. Clinical-Grade.

Aura is a 2026-era health intelligence system that treats biometrics as a continuous signal rather than a static record. It combines **deterministic heuristics** with **LLM-driven pattern synthesis** to provide a predictive health narrative while ensuring absolute user sovereignty.

## 🚀 Deployment & Sharing
Aura is built as a modern, local-first ESM application. You can deploy it in seconds:
*   **Vercel:** Connect repo -> Add `API_KEY` to Env Vars -> Deploy.
*   **Netlify:** Connect repo -> Add `API_KEY` to Site Settings -> Deploy.
*   **Cloudflare Pages:** Connect repo -> Select 'Static' -> Add Env Vars.

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for step-by-step instructions.

## 📄 Resume Snippets

### Option 1: Professional Summary (The "Architect" Profile)
> **Senior Health-Tech Architect & Full-Stack Engineer** with expertise in building sovereign intelligence systems. Engineered **Aura**, a privacy-first biometric dashboard that leverages **Gemini 3 Pro** for non-linear pattern synthesis and real-time readiness forecasting. Specialized in local-first architectures and medical-grade UI/UX.

### Option 2: Project Description (Bulleted for "Experience" section)
**Aura Health Intelligence | Lead Engineer & UI/UX Designer**
*   **Architecture:** Designed a "Neural Core" orchestrator that blends deterministic heuristics with probabilistic AI reasoning using the **Gemini API** for 14-day biometric correlation detection.
*   **Privacy:** Implemented a stateless "Health Sovereignty" framework ensuring 100% of biometric logs and AI memory nodes remain in local browser storage.
*   **AI Integration:** Developed real-time Vision AI modules for nutritional parsing and barcode analysis using multimodal LLM prompts.
*   **Safety:** Built a predictive "Safety Guard" engine to detect systemic distress signals and automatically pivot the UI into stabilizing recovery modes.
*   **UI/UX:** Authored a premium, high-performance React dashboard with hardware-accelerated animations (**Framer Motion**) and dynamic biometric visualizations (**Recharts**).

### Option 3: Technical Stack Bullet
> **Aura Health Intelligence:** React 19, TypeScript, Gemini 3 Pro/Flash API, Framer Motion, Recharts, Tailwind CSS. Engineered a local-first biometric reasoning engine with Vision-based food parsing and neural trajectory synthesis.
